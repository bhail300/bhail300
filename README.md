<h3>About me</h3>

- I am currently a student in the last term of the Digital Design and Development diploma program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.

- I'm primarily a UI/UX Designer, but I also have knowledge in front-end web development and graphic design.

- I plan to delve into back-end coding and possibly becoming a full stack web Developer.
